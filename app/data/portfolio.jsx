My team and I rocked our last Hackathon, getting second place within the Customer Support track.
<br><br>
<strong>Idea:</strong> <br>
Ever ended a call and realized you forgot something important? Of course it happens to the best of us.
<br><br>
Our AI creates a real-time summary during the call, helping support agents keep track of all questions, options discussed, and key points. It can also categorize the conversation, and highlight important moments. And create follow up questions to make sure the agent has all the information they need to create the ticket or mail.
<br><br>
Using AI and previous tickets the AI will be able to figure out what the best steps forward are. Sometimes a part of the ticket needs to go to 2 different departments. The AI will help make the emails.
<br><br>
After the call, agents can review the full transcript, edit the summary, or adjust the mood, category, and priority-ensuring nothing gets missed.
<br><br>

I want to thank Peder Linder & Per Lange for being amazing hosts! And the other 120 teams for making it an unforgettable event!

<br><br>
Initially, a low-code hackathon wasnâ€™t something I was particularly interested in, as I love coding and having the freedom to do whatever I want. However, OutSystems really surprised me!
<br><br>
When I think of low-code, I usually imagine anyone being able to build an app. But thatâ€™s far from the truth OutSystems is complex, yet full of powerful features.
<br><br>
A big thank you to the OutSystems team, without their support, it would have been impossible to build a working demo! Also, thanks to Per from Cillers for sponsoring the train tickets for both Hackathons.`,

My team and I spent the day at Amazon Stockholm for the Cillers Hackathon, building an AI tool to support customer service agents.
<br><br>
Just 1.5 weeks ago, we didn't even know each other. Now, we've grown into an amazing team, and we're definitely not done with hackathons!
<br><br>
We sadly failed our demo, but we learned a lot! Sometimes failing is exactly what you need to level up your skills.
<br><br>
Even with the failed demo, we placed 5th! Our storytelling and clear presentation made sure we took a high spot. Considering this was the first hackathon for most of us, I'd call that a win! ðŸ™Œ
<br><br>
Massive thanks to Cillers for hosting an amazing hackathon!`,
